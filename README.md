## Introduction
This project aims to analyse the regression model for powerproduction dataset.

## Overview of the data
As a first step, it carries on an overview of the data by a deep analysis of the dataset variables through diverse plots.
The aim is to see the behave of each of the variables and to potentially see potential correlation if any.

## Simple Linear Regression
In this section we try to find the simple linear regression for the entire dataset, it has been calculated along with other lines that looked better fit the dataset trend.

## Accuracy
By calculating the cost for each of the lines, it is certified that linear regression is the line with cost's lower value, so it's the better line among the proposed to fit best.

## Alternative
Since even with the linear regression, doesn't look the line match the dataset properly. It has been calculated a polynomial line for the model. After mean square error calculation, it has been demonstrated that for this dataset polynomial line match better than linear regression line.
